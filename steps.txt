steps
1. Run pre_proc.m
genertae dataset in the eeglab and filedtrip format 
resample 128Hz
filter 1-45Hz
remove first and last 5s
obtain the last 15s
remove DC channels (signals with zero value)
MARA: remove noise components,  and drop the data if its artificat components is > 60% of all ica components
save remains into data/useful directory

finally we have:
22 trials for competition
25 trials for cooperation
check data/info.txt file

3. Run timeFrequency.m
Calculate the spectral estimation and normalzied power for each trial
Use pop_newtimef funnction (eeglabe function)
ERSP = averaged power (averaged over epoches amount):  save with "trial_name_allersp.mat" 
ITPC = normalzied time-frequency:  save with "trial_name_allitc.mat" format

Notably, the frequency and time, which are returned by pop_newtimef function for each time-frequency analysis is different.
Here, 1409 frequwncy (ranging from 0 to 45Hz) and  60 timepoints (ranging from 0 to 15 seonds) are applied 


4. Run conn_cal.m to calculate inter-brain synchcrony over frequency and/or time
over frequency and time: 
ispc, spectral-coherence,pli,power-correlation: beta band (13-30)
MI: gamma band (31-45), 1000 bins 

calcculate functional connectiveity over frequency and over time: power-correlation and ISPC(phase-based)
over frequeny or time: power-correlation and ispc 

5. run conn_combined.m
combine each trials into one mat

5. run conn_sig.m /conn_sig_permutation.m
conn_sig.m: 
    1. do non-parametric test, get the real p value, 
    2. do permutation test get 1000 p-value
    3. test the real-p value weather is significant in all p-values 
conn_sig_permutation.m:
    permutation test with 500 shuffles ( threshold: 1%)
    Mannes recommended: the results paper applied

False discrovery rate: 5%

6. run plot_network_group.m;

plot_network_group.m;
    plot strong NS: addjacency matrix and brain maps
    threshold: one std + median of intra- and inter-brain NS
    outliers(a value that is more than three scaled median absolute deviations) were removed 
    
    commented code: plot granger causality in the end of this file

plot_network_group2.m:
    plot strong NS in brain maps
    threshold:
        for intra-brain NS, the threshold is visually detected by the distribution of intra-brain NS
        for INS, the top 10 highest INSs were chosen 



6.2.plot_NS_over_time_freq:
plot all intra- and inter-brain NS over time and frequency, 
time-consusing since there 441 plot for frequency and time and each trial 

6.3 plot_net_prop_over_freq.m

Plot the boxplot of gloabl efficien and small-world-ness over frequncy/time 
Plot the lineplot of GE/SWN of the median of team-brain network over frequency/tiime 



7. run network_properties.m

calcualate unthresholded weighted network properties and save into data/conn
Brain Connectivity Toolbox should be added into path

8. run cal_smallworldness.m 

method: Based on ER random network and transitivity clustering coefficient 
add path the library smallworldness-matser 
calculate SWN of intra- and team-brain network 

9. GE_cal: calculate global efficiency 

calculate GE of intra- and team-brain netwroks
add path Brain Connectivity Toolbox 


9. Run behavorial_glm.m

    1. Fit linear polynomial curves between game duration and INS/GE 
    Game duration is listed in the data/info.txt 
    2. Plot the betweeness centrality in brain maps
